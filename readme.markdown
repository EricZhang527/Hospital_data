**Acquiring The Data**
The raw data `hospital-data.csv` is acquired through a public repository I found in GitHub from user Donne Martin. The data is originally from *The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services*.

**What Is the Data's Purpose?**

The repository is created with the intention of providing the data and ways of manipulating them for those interested in hospital information across the United States, especially how the healthcare 
resources in North Carolina and South Carolina compare. To answer this question, data merging and comparison are implemented, as presented in the data subsets. 

**Getting Started**

This repository contains all necessary information on healthcare resources in the U.S. and users can manipulate them using the pandas module, and specific instructions for data management and editing
can be found in the example `Data_subsets.ipynb` file. 

**Within this repository you will find five files.**

*1. A .csv file (the raw data)*

This .csv file contains the original data published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It includes information across 13 columns and more than 4000 rows, representing over 4000 hospitals across the United States.

*2. A ipynb file containing the methods used to manipulate data and generate subsets of data.*

*3. A .csv file containing the subset of data from the original .csv file that compares the medical resources of South Carolina and North Carolina.*

This csv file is the subset of the original data, which compares and contrasts the hospital data from North Carolina and South Carolina.

*4 A .csv file containing the subset of data from the  oroginal .csv file that is used as an example of data merging.*

*5 This readme file. Have fun!*

**Playing around with the repository**

To get started exploring the repository and creating data subsets on your own, read through the ipynb notebook file and try to understand the ideas behind code snippets. Then, feel free to use the data manipulation method to generate your own data.
