# Hospital data
Hello, welcome to the Hospital data repository!
This is a data repository dedicated to providing hospital data from American hospitals and instructions on how to manipulate them.

As shown here in the files, the raw data is named "hospital-data.csv" and it contains information across 13 categories in over 4500 hospitals in the U.S. Please see the information provided in the ipynb file named "Feeder3_1.ipynb" to learn how to manipulate the data given in the form of csv, such as creating new data frames, filtering data, as well as merging and joining multiple sets of dataframes.

While you navigate through the repository, please note that data can be combined and compared in customized ways to generate new knowledge. For example, I provided two other csv files to illustrate the output of data manipulation via pandas. In the file named "Carolina.csv", I combined the data from the state of North Carolina with South Carolina, changing the filtering keywords can allow for comparison across different states in the United States, such as when analyzing the disparities in the distribution of healthcare resources in the U.S. In the file named Merge_data.csv, I illustrate a way in which two dataframes could be merged together, despite them having different column attributes. This can come in handy when making comparisons across different vectors, such as the presence of ambulatory care, the hospital type, etc.

Please have fun exploring the repository!
